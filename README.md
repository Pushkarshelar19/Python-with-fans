Welcome to my Python project! This project includes three interactive games (Heads and Tails, Dice, and Cubes) with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using tkinter.

## Heads and Tails
This game allows you to guess whether the coin will land on heads or tails. Make your choice, and the program will simulate a coin toss to see if you guessed correctly.
## Dice
In the dice game, you can guess a number between 1 and 6. The program will simulate rolling a six-sided die, and you'll win if your guess matches the result.
## Cubes
The cubes function displays the cubes of numbers in descending order. Enter a number, and the program will print the cube of each integer from your input down to 1.
## Usage
To run the program, execute the `python project.py` command in your terminal.
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
